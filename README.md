## Description
This application mimics a requirement of Prime Academy - at the end of each day we are asked to fill a form recording our experience for the day.
The form consists of multiple "pages" - this is actually a Single Page Application. Routes allow the user to move between them. 
Redux helps store the data of each user response so the parent component does not have to track each item.

## I Learned
Orchestrating the players of the server, Redux, and Sagas was a challenge. I understood how each worked but having them all work together really wrapped my head around what each do and how. 
Redux isn't so tough after all! :D
